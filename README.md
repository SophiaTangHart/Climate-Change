# Climate-Change

I applied data science to improve long-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

I implemented LightGBM, XGBoost, and RandomForestRegressor. I used PCA to reduce feature dimension. Data were 600MB (400,000 rows). I used feature engineering to account for data drift. I ranked top 20% of 2,000 global WiDS Datathon participants (while some teams consisted of multiple people, I worked independently), or my project was top 57% on Kaggle Leaderboard position and this was my first WiDS Datathon/Kaggle competition.

For future steps, I would implement ARIMA and compare its results with LightBGM, which was better than XGBoost in my project.

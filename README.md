I applied data science to improve long-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change. Current models are usually 10 days forecast and my model was 14 days forecast. The model was trained with actual weather data since 2014 in every region around the world. 

I implemented LightGBM, XGBoost, and RandomForestRegressor. I applied PCA to reduce feature dimension. I utilized feature engineering to account for data drift over time. I ranked top 20% of 2,000 global WiDS Datathon participants (while some teams consisted of multiple people, I worked independently, or my project was top 57% on Kaggle Leaderboard position). This was my first WiDS Datathon/Kaggle competition.

For future steps, I would implement multivariate ARIMA and compare its results with LightBGM, which gave better results and was faster to run than XGBoost in my project.
